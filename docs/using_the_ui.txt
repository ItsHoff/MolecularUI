Using the UI
------------

Components
==========
The UI contains a few components the user should be aware of. The most visible part
of the window the main view, which displays the current layer thats being edited.
On the top left corner of the main view there's the layer indicator which shows the 
number of the layer currently visible (or S/T for the surface). On the bottom of
the main view is the atom selector which allows the selection of the currently active
type and the editing of all the used atom types.

On the left side of the window there is the item menu, which lists all the available
items that can be added to the setup. On top of the menu there's the output button 
which will trigger the output creation. In addition to those there is the statusbar 
at the bottom of the window, which occasionaly displays some status and error messages, 
and on top there's the menubar which contains some of the functions of the UI.


Editing
=======
When you open the UI you should see the surface in the main view. You can zoom the 
view by scrolling and move around the surface by holding down the middle mousebutton 
or control and left mousebutton. The surface can be resized by dragging on its edges.
You can change the layer being edited by holding down control and scrolling or 
alternatively by pressing control + number key or ยง. Pressing number keys without 
control will let you temporarily peek the corresponding layer, but letting go of 
the key will return you back to the original layer. 

Left clicking the atoms lets you change their state. If the current state is different
from your currently selected atom the state will change to that atom, but if the 
state allready matches the selected atom then the state will be changed to vacant.
Keeping the left mouse button pressed lets you paint multiple atoms at once. When 
painting multiple atoms all the atoms will be changed to the same state as the first
atom you painted regardless of their current state. The text fields under the colored
buttons let you change which color corresponds with wich atom. 

You can add molecules and saved blocks to the layer by dragging the in to the view 
from the item menu. These items can be moved around by shift clicking them. Double 
click will rotate molecules that have rotations enabled. Keep in mind that molecules
can only be added to the surface and can only be interacted with when on the Top
mode. Top mode however won't let you interract with atoms under the molecules and for
that reason there's also the Surface only mode which disables interaction with molecules
but allows interraction with surface atoms.

Shift dragging will also allow you to select blocks of atoms. Right clicking the 
selection shows the context actions for the item. This allows you to fill all the 
selected atoms with the current atom type or vacate all the selected atoms. Selection 
also allows you to move the atoms by shift dragging. Deselecting the atoms will merge
the block back to the surface. You can also save these selections which makes them 
appear in the item menu under Surface Blocks. This way you can reuse and duplicate
existing parts of the setup.


Getting the output
==================
After you're satisfied with your setup you can get the output .xyz file by pressing 
the "Create Output" button at the top left corner of the window. You will be first 
shown the output options. You can select the number of layers you want to output in
addition to the surface layer. In addition you can see the atom types currently in
use and edit them before the output is created. After you are happy with the settings 
you will be prompted to save the output. By default the output will be saved in the
output folder but you can choose to save them elsewhere. After this you're free to 
do what ever you wish with the output file.


Saving
======
The UI includes a simple save and load functionality. You can save your setup by 
selecting save from the menubar or by pressing Control+S. Similarily selecting load 
from the menubar or pressing Control+L lets you load a previously saved setup.


Available settings
==================
The settings.py file allows you to set a few default values for the UI:
    - number_of_layers: Sets the number of layers to be loaded initially.
    - max_number_of_layers: Set the number maximum allowed layers. 
    - layer_size: Sets the default size of the layers. Will be rounded down to the
        nearest multiple of the base block size.
    - surface/substrate_atom_types: Set the atom types used for the surface and 
        substrate by default. 

This file also allows you to define your own molecules. For details refer to 
adding_molecules.txt.
